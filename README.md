# octengine-vulkan
### TODO
This is what I want to get done with the vulkan renderer before I start making this into an actual game engine
1. convert the program to not be C++/class based
2. draw models imported with assimp
3. skin models with armatures imported from blender (through assimp)
4. get basic lighting functioning (with structures to represent the lights)
5. create a camera structure and use it to orient the scene
6. draw textures on the models
7. implement PBR shading with the lighting and camera data
